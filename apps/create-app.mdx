An app is a collection of one or more services. Each app is associated with a project in a cluster. A project can have one or more apps in it.

Apps can be of any size or complexity, ranging from a simple HTTP service which responds with “hello world” to a set of microservices which talk to each other.

You can create a new app from the project page as shown below:

You can also create new apps from the "Apps" link in the menu.

The new App form looks like this:

The project indicates the project in which your app will be deployed.

#### Name

The name of your app. Can contain letters, numbers and the hyphen character. No other special character or spaces allowed. The name of the app is unique within a project.


#### stack

The "stack" denotes the tech stack for your app. Currently, the following stacks are supported:

| stack   | versions |
|---------|----------|
| Node.js | 16, 18, 20                 |
| Python  | 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 |
| Ruby    | 3.1, 3.2 |
| Golang  | 1.17, 1.18, 1.19, 1.20 |
| PHP     | 8.0, 8.1, 8.2 |
| Java    | 11, 17 |

#### Repo

The github repo link for your application code. Put the https link here if it is a public repo, and the ssh link if it is a private repo.

<Note>You have to [link your Github account](private-repos) before adding private repos.</Note>

#### Ref

The branch or tag in the repo which will be deployed.

#### Subpath

The relative path where your application code is. Skip this field if your application is at the top level.

<Note>This step creates your application configuration only, it doesn't deploy the app in the cluster yet.</Note>
