All containers powering your application run as a non-root user.

ShapeBlock uses your Github/Gitlab access tokens(if you furnish them) to deploy apps based on private repositories. This code is only stored in your servers and not in ShapeBlock.

Any data associated with your app is also not stored by ShapeBlock. It is only stored on your own servers.
