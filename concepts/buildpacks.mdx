ShapeBlock uses [Paketo buildpacks](https://paketo.io/) to build your application containers. All you need to do is provide the source code of your application.
Shapeblock will figure out how to build the container image by ordering a set of buildpacks which best match your application context.
There is not need to write any Dockerfile or know about containers to deploy ShapeBlock.

ShapeBlock caches various layers of an application container and rebuilds only the layers which have changed, thus reducing build times of applications.

<Note>
You cannot directly deploy a container image in ShapeBlock.
