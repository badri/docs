Projects are logical constructs to group applications and services in your clusters. There are modelled as kubernetes namespaces in the backend, with some additional loaded information, like registry secrets and service accounts.

There are many ways you can categorize your projects in a cluster.

If you are an agency and managing multiple portfolios using a single cluster, then each project will represent a single client.

You can have a "dev" project where you create dev and staging environments, and a "prod" project for production with different access controls for both projects.
