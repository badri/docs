ShapeBlock uses Helm to deploy applications in the cluster. Specifically, the [Epinio application helm chart](https://github.com/epinio/helm-charts/tree/main/chart/application) is used.

ShapeBlock automatically converts all your app config into a custom helm values file and deploys your app.

Currently, there is no other way to deploy an application in ShapeBlock.

Services are deployed using Bitnami helm charts.
