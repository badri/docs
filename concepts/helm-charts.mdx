ShapeBlock uses Helm to deploy applications in the cluster. Specifically, the [universal helm chart](https://github.com/nixys/nxs-universal-chart) is used.

ShapeBlock automatically converts all your app config into a custom helm values file and deploys your app.

Currently, there is no other way to deploy an application in ShapeBlock.
