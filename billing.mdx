ShapeBlock comes with a free tier applicable to every user who signs up. Under this free tier, you can create a 1-node cluster in any of the currently supported cloud providers.

In this cluster you can create upto 1 app(from a public or private repo) and upto 2 services.

If you want to create more than 1 app(or more than 2 services), create another cluster, add nodes to your cluster, or invite other users to collaborate on your cluster, consider upgrading for the paid plan.

Under the paid plan, you are billed $7 USD on the 1st of every month for every VM you use. This charge is prorated. If you create a VM and use it for 10 days, you will only be billed for those 10 days.

All payments and billing is handled by [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) and ShapeBlock doesn't store any card data in its servers.
