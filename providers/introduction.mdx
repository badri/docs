ShapeBlock is a “Bring-your-own-infrastructure” service. What it means is, you bring your own infrastructure on which clusters and applications are managed. ShapeBlock itself **doesn’t** provide any computing resources.

The first thing you need to do to create your own cluster is to add your favorite cloud provider’s API keys. This will be consumed by ShapeBlock at the time of creating a new cluster to provision the infrastructure needed to create the cluster.
