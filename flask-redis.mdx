Use [this git repo](https://github.com/badri/flask-redis/) as a reference implementation.

The above repo contains a `.sb.yml` file which is a specification of the entire app's configuration. Check [.sb.yml file](/apps/.sb.yml) for more information.

This will implement a simple endpoint in Flask which will increment a counter everytime the page is loaded in the browser.

It uses Redis to keep track of the count.

## Preparing your code

Fetch the Redis credentials from environment variables in the app.

```py
import redis
from flask import Flask
redis_host = os.getenv('REDIS_HOST')
redis_password = os.getenv('REDIS_PASSWORD')
app = Flask(__name__)
cache = redis.Redis(host=redis_host, password=redis_password, port=6379)
```

## .sb.yml

```yaml
env_vars:
  FLASK_APP: app.py
  FLASK_RUN_HOST: 0.0.0.0
  FLASK_RUN_PORT: "8080"

services:
  data-cache:
    type: redis
    attach_as: separate_variables
```

The environment variables are staple Flask environment variables needed to run your Flask app.

In addition to this, we create a redis service called `data-cache` and attach it to the app using separate variables.


## Procfile

We add a `Procfile` which is the idomatic way to run Flask apps.

```txt
web: flask run
```

<Note>
`web` is the name of the default process which will run in the app container.
</Note>

Deploying this app will create a Flask server and a redis cache.
