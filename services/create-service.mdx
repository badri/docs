Chances are you might want to talk to a database from your app.
Although it is recommended to use a managed database and configure it as a [runtime environment variable](configure-app#runtime-variables), it is also possible to spin up such services inside your cluster and atttach them to your app.

ShapeBlock currently supports the following services:

- MySQL
- Postgres
- MongoDB
- Redis
- Open search
- RabbitMQ

<Note>
If you want to use any of the above services in your app, you have to spin up that service in the same project as that of the app.
</Note>

You can add a service by going to the "services" link in the top menu,

![Serivces menu]()

and clicking "Create Service".

or by visiting your project's "Services" tab,

![Porjects service tab]()

and clicking "Create Service".


![Create service]()

The service creation form has the following parameters:

### Project

Which project the service belongs to.

<Note>
You have to create the service in the same project where the app which will talk to this service.
</Note>

### Name

The name of the service. Can contain letters and numbers. No spaces, special characters except hyphen(`-`).

### Type of service

Whether it is Postgres, MySQL, MongoDB etc.

<Note>
There are other services on the roadmap, but not available at this time.
