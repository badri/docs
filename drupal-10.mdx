Use [this git repo](https://github.com/shapeblock/drupal-10/) as a reference implementation.

The above repo contains a `.sb.yml` file which is a specification of the entire app's configuration. Check [.sb.yml file](/apps/.sb.yml) for more information.

## Preparing your code

You have to make the following changes to your code base:

### PHP extensions to load

Create a folder in your top level directory called `.php.ini.d`. Create a file with the name `drupal.ini` with the following contents.

```
[PHP]
engine = On
short_open_tag = Off
precision = 14
output_buffering = 4096
zlib.output_compression = Off
implicit_flush = Off
unserialize_callback_func =
serialize_precision = -1
disable_functions =
disable_classes =
zend.enable_gc = On
expose_php = Off
max_execution_time = 30
max_input_time = 60
memory_limit = 128M
error_reporting = E_ALL & ~E_DEPRECATED & ~E_STRICT
display_errors = Off
display_startup_errors = Off
log_errors = On
log_errors_max_len = 1024
ignore_repeated_errors = Off
ignore_repeated_source = Off
report_memleaks = On
html_errors = On
variables_order = "GPCS"
request_order = "GP"
register_argc_argv = Off
auto_globals_jit = On
post_max_size = 100M
auto_prepend_file =
auto_append_file =
default_mimetype = "text/html"
default_charset = "UTF-8"
doc_root =
user_dir =
enable_dl = Off
file_uploads = On
upload_max_filesize = 100M
max_file_uploads = 20
allow_url_fopen = On
allow_url_include = Off
default_socket_timeout = 60

extension = bz2.so
extension = curl.so
extension = dba.so
extension = enchant.so
extension = fileinfo.so
extension = gd.so
extension = ldap.so
extension = mbstring.so
extension = openssl.so
extension = pdo.so
extension = pdo_mysql.so
extension = pdo_sqlite.so
extension = readline.so
extension = soap.so
extension = sodium.so
extension = sockets.so
extension = xsl.so
extension = zip.so
extension = zlib.so

zend_extension = xdebug.so
zend_extension = opcache.so
```
This configures the PHP extensions to be loaded in your application. The filename doesn't matter, as long as it ends with `.ini`.

<Note>
The PHP buildpack loads only the extensions you want for performance reasons. So, you will have to create this file for any PHP app you deploy.
</Note>

Here's a reference implementation of the same: https://github.com/shapeblock/drupal-10/blob/main/.php.ini.d/drupal.ini.

### Nginx configuration

All PHP buildpacks run PHP FPM served by Nginx. Drupal needs custom nginx configuration. Create a folder at the top level called `.nginx.conf.d` and create a file with the following contents:

```
client_max_body_size 100m;
# forward http to https
if ($redirect_to_https = "yes") {
    return 301 https://$http_host$request_uri;
}
# Deny hidden files (.htaccess, .htpasswd, .DS_Store).
location ~ /\. {
    deny            all;
    access_log      off;
    log_not_found   off;
}

location = /favicon.ico {
    log_not_found off;
    access_log off;
}

location = /robots.txt {
    allow all;
    log_not_found off;
    access_log off;
}

# Very rarely should these ever be accessed outside of your lan
location ~* \.(txt|log)$ {
    allow 192.168.0.0/16;
    deny all;
}

location ~ \..*/.*\.php$ {
    return 403;
}

location ~ ^/sites/.*/private/ {
    return 403;
}

# Block access to scripts in site files directory
location ~ ^/sites/[^/]+/files/.*\.php$ {
    deny all;
}

# Allow "Well-Known URIs" as per RFC 5785
location ~* ^/.well-known/ {
    allow all;
}

# Block access to "hidden" files and directories whose names begin with a
# period. This includes directories used by version control systems such
# as Subversion or Git to store control files.
location ~ (^|/)\. {
    return 403;
}

index index.php;

location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
}

location @rewrite {
    #rewrite ^/(.*)$ /index.php?q=$1; # For Drupal <= 6
    rewrite ^ /index.php; # For Drupal >= 7
}

# Don't allow direct access to PHP files in the vendor directory.
location ~ /vendor/.*\.php$ {
    deny all;
    return 404;
}

# Protect files and directories from prying eyes.
location ~* \.(engine|inc|install|make|module|profile|po|sh|.*sql|theme|twig|tpl(\.php)?|xtmpl|yml)(~|\.sw[op]|\.bak|\.orig|\.save)?$|^(\.(?!well-known).*|Entries.*|Repository|Root|Tag|Template|composer\.(json|lock)|web\.config)$|^#.*#$|\.php(~|\.sw[op]|\.bak|\.orig|\.save)$ {
    deny all;
    return 404;
}

location ~ '\.php$|^/update.php' {
    try_files $uri =404;
    fastcgi_param  QUERY_STRING       $query_string;
    fastcgi_param  REQUEST_METHOD     $request_method;
    fastcgi_param  CONTENT_TYPE       $content_type;
    fastcgi_param  CONTENT_LENGTH     $content_length;
    fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_NAME        $fastcgi_script_name;
    fastcgi_param  REQUEST_URI        $request_uri;
    fastcgi_param  DOCUMENT_URI       $document_uri;
    fastcgi_param  DOCUMENT_ROOT      $document_root;

    fastcgi_param  SERVER_ADDR        $server_addr;
    fastcgi_param  SERVER_PORT        $server_port;
    fastcgi_param  SERVER_NAME        $host;
    fastcgi_param HTTP_PROXY "";
    fastcgi_param   SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    fastcgi_pass    php_fpm;
}

# Fighting with Styles? This little gem is amazing.
# location ~ ^/sites/.*/files/imagecache/ { # For Drupal <= 6
location ~ ^/sites/.*/files/styles/ { # For Drupal >= 7
    try_files $uri @rewrite;
}

# Handle private files through Drupal. Private file's path can come
# with a language prefix.
location ~ ^(/[a-z\-]+)?/system/files/ { # For Drupal >= 7
    try_files $uri /index.php?$query_string;
}

# Enforce clean URLs
# Removes index.php from urls like www.example.com/index.php/my-page --> www.example.com/my-page
# Could be done with 301 for permanent or other redirect codes.
if ($request_uri ~* "^(.*/)index\.php/(.*)") {
    return 307 $1$2;
}
```

This is standard nginx configuration for running Drupal 8+. The clean URLs feature won't work without this configuration. The filename doesn't matter as long as it ends with `.conf`.

Here's a reference implementation. https://github.com/shapeblock/drupal-10/blob/main/.nginx.conf.d/drupal-server.conf

### Update settings.php

Update Drupal's `settings.php` file by adding a custom settings.php which will pull database credentials from environment files.

```php
if (file_exists($app_root . '/' . $site_path . '/settings.shapeblock.php')) {
  include $app_root . '/' . $site_path . '/settings.shapeblock.php';
}
```

Please add this in the end before your local setup settings(if any).
Reference implementation: https://github.com/shapeblock/drupal-10/blob/main/web/sites/default/settings.php

Next, we have to add the `settings.shapeblock.php` file in the same folder.

<Note>
The name of the file is arbitrary. It can even be `settings.prod.php`.
</Note>

```php
<?php
use Drupal\Core\Installer\InstallerKernel;


$config['system.logging']['error_level'] = 'verbose';

  $databases['default']['default'] = [
    'driver' => 'mysql',
    'database' => getenv('DB_NAME'),
    'username' => getenv('DB_USER'),
    'password' => getenv('DB_PASSWORD'),
    'host' => getenv('DB_HOST'),
    'port' => '3306',
    'init_commands' => [
      'isolation_level' => 'SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED',
    ],
  ];

$settings['trusted_host_patterns'] = ['.*'];
$settings['hash_salt'] = getenv('HASH_SALT');
```

Reference: https://github.com/shapeblock/drupal-10/blob/main/web/sites/default/settings.shapeblock.php

### Permissions

The Drupal installer rewrites `settings.php` file during installation, even when we provide one. For this, we need to provide explicit write access to `settings.php`.
The default container runtime in ShapeBlock is a readonly filesystem for security reasons. We have to provide explicit access to the `settings.php` file.

For this, we have to create a `chmod.sh` and give a list of file(s) and what permissions to give. In this case, the file will look like this:

```sh
chmod a+w /workspace/web/sites/default/settings.php
```

### MySQL client (optional)

If we want to run `drush`, some drush commands require the mysql-client package to be installed in the container. This is not installed by default.
We have to create a new file in the top level directory called `Aptfile` and add the apt package name there.

```
mysql-client
```

Reference: https://github.com/shapeblock/drupal-10/blob/main/Aptfile

If your application needs any other packages, it can be added to this file.

## Services

Drupal needs a MySQL database to store the content generated by users. You have to [create a service](/services/create-service) og type "MySQL" and [attach](/services/attach-service) it to the app before deploying it.

![Drupal services](/images/drupal-services.png)

## Build variables

You have to specify the docroot of your drupal installation using the `BP_PHP_WEB_DIR` variable. For the above repo, it will be `web`.

<Note>
For any PHP app, the default docroot is the top level directory of your code. If you want this to be something else, you have to set the `BP_PHP_WEB_DIR` relative to the directory structure of your code base.
</Note>

| Variable Name | Value | Notes |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| BP_PHP_SERVER | nginx | Indicates what web server we will be using. |
| BP_RUN_COMPOSER_INSTALL | 1 | A Drupal specific build variable which tells not to wipe out composer installed packages in the code base, i.e. the contrib modules and themes. Not needed for other PHP frameworks. |
| BP_PHP_ENABLE_CACHE_CONTROL | false | Disable nginx cache control, which messes with Nginx serving aggregated and compressed Drupal static files. |
| BP_PHP_VERSION | Latest version of PHP | **Optional**. Supports 8.1 and 8.2 |

![Drupal build vars](/images/drupal-build-vars.png)

## Runtime variables

When you attach a service, it creates environment variables which contain service information and credentials.

<Note>
Please ensure that the variable name matches the ones given in `settings.php`. You can change either the variable names here or in the `settings.php` file accordingly.
</Note>

These should look something like this:

| Variable Name | Value | Notes |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| DB_HOST | `<service name>-mysql` | Hostname of the mysql service which is attached. |
| DB_NAME | shapeblock | Name of the database |
| DB_USER | shapeblock | Name of the DB user who has access to the above database. |
| DB_PASSWORD | shapeblock | Password for the DB user above |

![Drupal env vars](/images/drupal-runtime-vars.png)

Drupal also needs a `HASH_SALT` secret to be provided.

| Variable Name | Value | Notes |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| HASH_SALT | `<some generated secret string>` | |

![Drupal secrets](/images/drupal-secrets.png)

<Note>
All secrets are readonly. Once created, they cannot be edited. You have to delete and recreate them.
</Note>


## Volumes

Drupal needs persistent storage to store user uploaded files. For this, we need to create a new volume mount.

| Mount Name | Mount path | Size | Notes |
|------------|------------|-------|------|
| public-files | /workspace/web/sites/default/files | 2GiB | The name of the mount is arbitrary and for your  reference only. |

<Note>
The mount path is the path you want to persist. This is an absolute path. All apps in ShapeBlock are deployed in the `/workspace` directory of the container. In our Drupal app, the public files directory will be `/workspace/web/sites/default/files`.
</Note>

![Drupal volumes](/images/drupal-volume.png)

You can optionally create another mount for storing Drupal's private files.

Once the app is deployed successfully, you should be able to view the Drupal site.
