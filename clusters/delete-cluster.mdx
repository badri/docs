ShapeBlock deletes all the resources and artefacts it created when you delete a cluster.

You can check this by going to your cloud provider and search by tags:

- VMs
- SSH keys
- Volumes

<Warning>If you see any resource lingering around after deleting the cluster, please reach out to support.</Warning>
