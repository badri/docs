You can add multiple nodes to your cluster if you need more compute resources for deploying your apps.

This can be done by going to the "Cluster details" page under the "Create new VMs" section.

![create new VMs]()

You can add one or more VMs in this form and hit "save".

This will trigger a cluster scale operation.

<Note>
This won't affect the state of any of the existing apps or services which are presently running in the cluster.
</Note>

Once the cluster scale operation is successful, the newly added VMs will show up like this.

![scaled VMs]()

It typically takes around 10 minutes to scale a cluster and is usually independent of the number of nodes being added.

<Note>
For each VM you add, you will be billed $10 USD per VM per month prorated.
