Projects are a way to namespace different apps and resources across a single cluster.


You can create new projects from the cluster page as shown below:

You can also create new projects from the "Pojects" link in the menu.

You can configure project-level settings on the settings tab of the project. Currently, there is no way to rename a project, but you can always delete a project.

**NOTE** Deleting a project will remove all the applications and services running in that project and this operation cannot be undone.
