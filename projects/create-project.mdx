Projects are a way to namespace different apps and resources across a single cluster.


You can create new projects from the cluster page as shown below:

This won't have any cluster to select from.

You can also create new projects from the "Pojects" link in the menu.

<Note>
A project name is converted to snake case automatically when storing internally. You have to ensure that a project name is unique across a cluster.
</Note>

You can configure project-level settings on the settings tab of the project.

Currently, there is no way to rename a project, but you can always delete a project.

<Note>Deleting a project will remove all the applications and services running in that project and this operation cannot be undone.</Note>
