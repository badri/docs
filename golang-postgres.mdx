Use [this git repo](https://github.com/shapeblock/go-webapp/) as a reference implementation.

The above repo contains a `.sb.yml` file which is a specification of the entire app's configuration. Check [.sb.yml file](/apps/.sb.yml) for more information.

This will create a Golang based web server which talks to a Postgres DB and helps you manage TODOs.

## Preparing your code

The `.sb.yml` file contains a build variable to preserve the static files needed to render the app. It contains 2 environment variables to indicate the application port and DB port.

It also creates a postgres DB called `todo-db` to store the todo data.

```yaml
build_vars:
  BP_KEEP_FILES: "assets/*:templates/*"

env_vars:
  PORT: "8080"
  DB_PORT: "5432"

services:
  todo-db:
    type: postgres
    attach_as: separate_variables
```

The `db/db.go` contains code to fetch DB config from environment variables.

```golang
	// CONFIG VARS
	DB_HOST := os.Getenv("DB_HOST")
	DB_PORT := os.Getenv("DB_PORT")
	DB_PASSWORD := os.Getenv("DB_PASSWORD")
	DB_NAME := os.Getenv("DB_NAME")
	DB_USER := os.Getenv("DB_USER")
```
